<h1> Pong </h1>

<h2>Ported from SVN repo on Assembla</h2>

<p>
This is a clone for the game pong. Controls are mapped as follows
</p>

<p>
Player 1:
<ul>
  <li>Up   - Q</li>
  <li>Down - A</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Player 2:
  <ul>
    <li>Up   - Up Arrow</li>
    <li>Down - Down Arrow</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Game Concepts:
  <ul>
    <li>The ball gains speed with each time it collides with another game object (wall or paddle).</li>
    <li>Players can adjust their score color</li>
    <li>A new game must me made for any AI/Color/Difficulty changes to take effect</li>
    <li>As the difficulty increases, the paddle shrinks.</li>
    <li>As the computer player difficulty level increases, the computer is able to react quicker to the ball.
      (The expert level computer player jumps to the balls position immediatly and basically impossible to beat).</li>
  </ul>
